Module: A parallelization module.   It performs actions in parallel to make it
        easy for a user to call a function with a list of tasks.

Start date: November 11th, 2008

This module is adapted from code in seash which had similar functionality.

NOTE (for the programmer using this module).   It's really important to 
write concurrency safe code for the functions they provide us.  It will not 
work to write:

def foo(...):
  mycontext['count'] = mycontext['count'] + 1

YOU MUST PUT A LOCK AROUND SUCH ACCESSES.

# I use this to get unique identifiers.

  """An error occurred when operating on a parallelized task"""


# This has information about all of the different parallel functions.
# The keys are unique integers and the entries look like this:
# {'abort':False, 'callfunc':callfunc, 'callargs':callargs,
# 'targetlist':targetlist, 'availabletargetpositions':positionlist,
# 'runninglist':runninglist, 'result':result}
#
# abort is used to determine if future events should be aborted.
# callfunc is the function to call
# callargs are extra arguments to pass to the function
# targetlist is the list of items to call the function with
# runninglist is used to track which events are executing
# result is a dictionary that contains information about completed function.
#    The format of result is:
#      {'exception':list of tuples with (target, exception string), 
#       'aborted':list of targets,
#       'returned':list of tuples with (target, return value)}
