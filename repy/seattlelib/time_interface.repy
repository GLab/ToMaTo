<Purpose>
  Provide a framework to run any implementation of a ntp time service that
  follows the interface provided here.

  Any implementation must provide update method that takes a localport 
  as an argument.

  Implementers will set a mapping to their functions by calling 
  time_register_method

  USE:
  
  To use this module, first make a call to time_updatetime(localport),where
  localport is a valid UDP port that you can send and receive on (note that
  this port may not be used depending on the implementation.)

  Then, to get the actual time, call time_gettime() which will return
  the current time (in seconds).

  time.repy will attempt to use the update method of any impelemntor included.
  If none are included or if they all fail an exception is thrown

   <Purpose>
    Obtains and stores the local time from a subset of NTP servers.

    until one succeeds or they all fail

   <Arguments>
    localport:
             The local port that MAY be used when contacting the NTP server(s).
             Consider this port a hint and not a rule.
   
   <Exceptions>
    Exception occurs when all methods fail to updatetime, or no such methods 
    are provided (no mehtods have registered)

   <Side Effects>
    time_settime(currenttime) is called as the sub process of a sub process,
    which adjusts the current time.

    None.
