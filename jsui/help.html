<h1>Topology creation</h1>
<p>A topology element can be added by dragging the prototype of the element from the palette on the
left into the workarea on the right. Once added, the elements can be moved inside the workarea by
dragging them. Elements can be selected by clicking on them; multiple elements can be selected be
holding the shift-key while clicking on them.</p>
<p>Devices can be connected to connectors by selecting one element and then clicking on the other
while holding the control key. If multiple elements are selected, all of them will be connected to
the element. Two devices can also be connected this way, an switch will be automatically created 
between them.</p>
<p>Elements can be removed by selecting them and then clicking on the remove icon on the lower
left.</p>

<h1>Wizard usage</h1>
<p>The wizard can be started by clicking on the widard icon in the palette. The wizard will open 
and properties of the new topology can be changed. If devices have been selected before opening the
wizard, these devices will be used to create the topology and the settings for new devices are 
greyed out. If no devices have been selected, the devices will be created by the wizard. After 
configuring the wizard, the area to create new devices must be selected by dragging and resizing a
frame. When the create button i pressed all the devices will be created and connected according to
the seelcted topology</p>

<h1>Property editing</h1>
All elements have an associated property dialog that can be accessed by double-clicking the
element. In this dialog, various properties of the element can be changed. Text fields often offer
a syntax check: if the contents of the field are invalid the text will be colored red.

<h1>Interface auto-configuration</h1>
All interfaces of OpenVZ devices are automatically preconfigured with the following properties:
<ul>
<li>Every connector will be given its own 10.x.y.z/16 subnet so that all connectors have different
networks.</li>
<li>Switches and hubs will have a simple flat network where all interfaces will get a uniq ip 
address in their subnet so that all devices can communicate.</li>
<li>Every interface on a router will have its own /24 subnet in the /16 subnet of the router. The
interface will have the ip address ending in 1 and the gateway will be configured to have the ip 
address ending in a 254 so that all devices on the router can communicate if the routes are 
configured properly.</li>
<li>Interfaces connected to special connectors like the internet are configured to use DHCP to
obtain an address.</li>
</ul>
