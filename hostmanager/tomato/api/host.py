	This method returns a dict with information about all available elements,
	connections and resources. If contains the following fields:
	
	``elements``
	  This field is a dict that contains the available element types as keys
	  and one dict with the following information per element type as the 
	  values.
	  
	  ``actions``
		This field contains a dict with all available actions as keys and 
		per action a list with states in which this action is available as 
		value.
	  ``next_state``
		This field contains a dict with all actions that are needed to change
		the state of the element as keys and the resulting states as values.
		Note that not all actions that change the state will be listed here.
		Actions that change the state in an indefinite way will not be listed
		here.
	  ``children``
		This field contains a dict with all allowed children types as keys and 
		per child type a list with states in which this child type can be added
		as value.
	  ``parent``
		This field contains a list of allowed parent types. Since the parent
		can only be set upon creation, the state of this element is already 
		known.
	  ``con_concepts``
		This field contains a list of connection concepts that this element
		supports. The entries in the list are used to find matching connection
		types. If this list is empty, this element can not be connected.
	  ``attrs``
		This field contains a dict with all attribute names as the keys and a
		dict with the following fields as values:

		``name``
		  The name of the attribute, this is the same as the key of the parent 
		  dict.
		``unit``
		  The unit of the value if it is numeric.
		``states``
		  A list with object states in which this attribute can be modified. If
		  this field is not set, the attribute can be modified in all states.
		  Attributes that can not be changed at all are not listed here.
		``default``
		  The default value for this field if it is different from ``None``.
		``null``
		  Whether this field can be set to ``None``. Defaults to ``False``.
		``desc``
		  A short description of the attribute.
		``type``
		  The type of the attribute. The type can either be ``int``, ``float``,
		  ``str`` or ``bool``. If the field is not set, all types, even complex
		  ones, are allowed. If the incoming data is not of this type, a 
		  primitive type conversion using the type methods is tried first 
		  before failing.
		``options``
		  If this field is set, it must contain a list of allowed values. 
		  Setting the attribute to any other value will fail.
		``regExp``
		  If this field is set, all incoming data must match the regular 
		  expression contained in this field. 
		``minValue``, ``maxValue``
		  The minimum and maximum allowed values. 
	
	``connections``
	  This field is a dict that contains the available connections types as 
	  keys and one dict with the following information per connection type
	  as the values.
	  
	  ``actions``
		This field has the same content as the field *actions* in *elements*.
	  ``next_state``
		This field has the same content as the field *next_state* in 
		*elements*.
	  ``con_concepts``
		This field contains a list of connection concept tuples. Each tuple
		is a list of two connection concepts. If elements should be connected,
		this field must contain a tuple where one connection concept is 
		supported by one element and the other is supported by the other 
		element. This field will never be empty since such connection types
		would be useless.
	  ``attrs``
		This field has the same content as the field *attrs* in *elements*.
	
	``resources``
	  This field contains a dict of supported resource types as keys and empty
	  dicts (``{}``) as values.
