        Dear %(username)s,

        Welcome to the ToMaTo-Lab testbed. Your registration will be reviewed by our administrators shortly. Until then, you can create a topology (but not start it).
        You should also subscribe to our mailing list at https://lists.uni-kl.de/tomato-lab.
        
        Best Wishes,
        The ToMaTo Testbed
